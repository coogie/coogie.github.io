        <h1>Dulce et Decorum Est</h1>
      </header>
      <main>
        <p>
          Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br>
          Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br>
          Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs<br>
          And towards our distant rest began to trudge.<br>
          Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots<br>
          But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;<br>
          Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br>
          Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!</strong>—An ecstasy of fumbling,<br>
          Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;<br>
          But someone still was yelling out and stumbling<br>
          And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime...<br>
          Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,<br>
          As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.
        </p>

        <p>
          In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,<br>
          He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.
        </p>

        <p>
          If in some smothering dreams you too could pace<br>
          Behind the wagon that we flung him in,<br>
          And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br>
          His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;<br>
          If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood<br>
          Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br>
          Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br>
          Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—<br>
          My friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br>
          To children ardent for some desperate glory,<br>
          The old Lie: <em>Dulce et decorum est<br>
          Pro patria mori.</em>
