        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been just over a year since <a href="http://coog.ie/blog/2013/08/18/a-new-octopress-theme/">I first released Oscailte</a> into the wild.
And since then, I&rsquo;ve not only learned a few things about working with Octopress
and creating themes for it, but I&rsquo;ve also learned a lot about managing my code,
its structure, and in general how to make my life easier when creating projects.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>When I first created Oscailte, I had planned to create a personal theme for myself
and never really intended (or expected) for it to be used by anybody else. Yet here
we are 103 stars and 24 forks later, and Oscailte is being used by people such as
<a href="http://fusion94.org/">Tony Guntharp</a> (co-founder of SourceForge.net), the <a href="http://www.nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri parsing gem</a>,
and even The University of Virginia&rsquo;s <a href="http://cs1110.cs.virginia.edu/">Intro to Programming course portal</a>. So
it&rsquo;s been a little humbling, to say the least, that these people (among others) are
happily using Oscailte for their Octopress installations! :D</p>

<p>And with that, I&rsquo;d like to <a href="https://github.com/coogie/oscailte/releases">re-release Oscailte as v2.0</a>, which contains a great
deal of changes to the theme and how it&rsquo;s structured, while keeping the original
aestehtics of it intact. There are some slight changes here and there that do change
the overall style of it, but only very slightly, and I&rsquo;d like to just quickly go over
some of the changes here.</p>

<h2 class="title--indent">Goodbye Inuit.css</h2>


<p>While I absolutely love Harry Roberts and everything he&rsquo;s done for the industry, I
have decided to remove inutcss from Oscailte. I feel as though I liked the concepts
used throughout it than the actual project itself. The project isn&rsquo;t bad, at all, it&rsquo;s
just that I didn&rsquo;t use enough of it throughout Oscailte to warrant having it as a
dependency.</p>

<h2 class="title--indent">Architecture</h2>


<p>The original architecture of Oscailte was a mess. It was hastily cobbled together and
didn&rsquo;t really make much sense looking back at it. It was also a bit of a nightmare to
maintain! That&rsquo;s all changed now that I have started applying the <a href="https://github.com/coogie/oscailte/blob/master/sass/oscailte/_oscailte.scss">concept of SMACSS into
it</a>. Structure makes a lot more sense now, and things are so much easier to find and modify.</p>

<h2 class="title--indent">Block-Element-Modifier (BEM)</h2>


<p>BEM is something that has interested me for quite some time now, and it&rsquo;s a methodology
that I have even started applying to my own code in work. It&rsquo;s an amazing naming
convention that, put simply, makes your code easier to understand. There are
other benefits to this as well, such as reduced specificity issues, which makes
BEM a win-win for me. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more, check out <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/">&ldquo;MindBEMding – getting your head ’round BEM syntax&rdquo;</a>
over on CSS Wizardy.</p>

<h2 class="title--indent">Variables and customisation</h2>


<p>Customisation is a huge thing for me. I&rsquo;m working really hard to make Oscailte
incredibly simple to customise with as little work as possible. As such, I&rsquo;ve
extracted as many of the styles as possible out into SCSS variables - so much
more than before! Sure, <a href="https://github.com/coogie/oscailte/blob/fb04062e3099d9d901bf848d6eafefb300d73b8e/sass/oscailte/_variables.scss">older versions of Oscailte had SCSS variables</a>, but
there wasn&rsquo;t a great deal of them, they could be somewhat confusing, and I&rsquo;m pretty
sure they were broken in one or two places. Now there are a <a href="https://github.com/coogie/oscailte/blob/master/sass/oscailte/_variables.scss">huge amount of SCSS
variables available in Oscailte 2.0</a>, and they are all broken out into their
respective components and sections.</p>

<h2 class="title--indent">Octopress 3 and Open Source</h2>


<p>So, with <a href="">Octopress 3</a> just around the corner, I do have plans to migrate
Oscailte over to support it. I have no idea how much work is involved in doing
so, I haven&rsquo;t even had the time to sit down and check out Octopress 3 for myself,
but it will happen. If there&rsquo;s one thing that this project has done for me, it&rsquo;s
help bolster my love for Open Source and make me want to keep giving back!</p>

        <link href="https://coog.ie/blog/2013/08/18/a-new-octopress-theme/"/>
        <updated>2013-08-18T23:59:00+01:00</updated>
        <id>https://coog.ie/blog/2013/08/18/a-new-octopress-theme</id>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Allow me to introduce to you a new Octopress theme, called Oscailte!</p>

<p>Oscailte is an important milestone for me for many reasons. First of all, it&rsquo;s my first step into creating a theme usable by anybody, not just by me on my own sites! Yay! Secondly, it&rsquo;s the first open-source project that I&rsquo;ve put out into the great wild web, free for all to download and scrutinise through <a href="https://github.com/coogie/oscailte/">Github</a>!</p>

<p>But enough about all of this, let&rsquo;s move on to getting the theme up and running. These installation instructions are available in the <a href="https://github.com/coogie/oscailte/blob/master/README.md">theme&rsquo;s README file</a> which will have the most up-to-date instructions.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://i.imgur.com/0GlIXHW.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/0GlIXHW.jpg</a>&#8221; title=&#8221;Oscailte Preview&#8221; ></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Oscailte requires that your system be running Sass 3.2.9 (Media Mark) or greater, so you may need to run a <code>bundle update</code> before you run your initial <code>rake generate</code> after installing the theme. You can check your current gem version by running <code>gem list sass</code>.</p>

<p>Because Oscailte also uses git submodules to pull in <a href="http://inuitcss.com">inuitcss</a>, when you run <code>git clone</code> you must add in the <code>--recursive</code> option in order to get it working.</p>

<p>You can install Oscailte like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_octopress_directory
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/coogie/oscailte.git .themes/oscailte
$ rake install['oscailte']
$ rake generate
</code></pre>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Homepage</h3>

<p>Oscailte includes a clean page, separated from the blogging capabilities of Octopress. The theme can be modified to instead use just the blog index as the homepage.</p>

<h3>Gravatar</h3>

<p>Oscailte makes use of the <code>site.email</code> used in <code>_config.yml</code> (if present) to grab and display your Gravatar if you use one. Otherwise, the theme will instead display the default Gravatar logo, which can be changed by replacing the file locally.</p>

<p>If you wish to make use of the Gravatar feature, please ensure you use an email address that you do not mind being publicly crawlable by bots/spiders.</p>

<h3>Social Sidebar</h3>

<p>Oscailte allows you to display links to your other online profiles in a quick and easy fashion. To display the sidebar links to your other profiles, you must add the following to your <code>_config.yml</code> file.</p>

<p><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>social:
</span><span class='line'>  title: # Defaults to &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; if not present
</span><span class='line'>  adn: # App.net
</span><span class='line'>  dribbble:
</span><span class='line'>  facebook:
</span><span class='line'>  github:
</span><span class='line'>  googleplus:
</span><span class='line'>  linkedin:
</span><span class='line'>  pinterest:
</span><span class='line'>  stackoverflow:
</span><span class='line'>  twitter:
</span><span class='line'>  youtube:</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Oscailte only supports the above sites, but more may be added as the user sees fit.</p>

<h2>Collaboration</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/coogie/oscailte">Oscailte is available on Github</a> under the <a href="https://github.com/coogie/oscailte/blob/master/LICENCE.md">MIT Licence</a>! I would greatly appreciate any help in both optimising the theme and improving the customisation available to users, so if you want to help out then feel free to <a href="https://github.com/coogie/oscailte/issues">submit issues or pull requests</a>!</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s Oscailte, my first Octopress theme! I learned a lot about both Octopress and theme development from this project. And if <em>you</em> would like to learn anything or just have questions about Oscailte, the feel free to get in touch with me or leave a comment below!</p>
