          best-in-class tools for rapid onboarding of new partners. While the existing

          construction and content management of each page via a headless CMS and modular
          components.</p>

          <p>The Prism Styling Framework & Design System is an initiative
          to provide a best-in-class system to help synergise design and development
          functions, aiming to blur the line between when design stops and development
          starts and easing transition between the two, reducing friction between teams.
          This is accomplished by working very closely with design teams to create a
          standard library of known components and styles that can be called upon, at a
          whim, to create almost any visual representation of CarTrawler products with
          full confidence in their accurate representation in-browser.</p>
          
          <p>In addition to this, the Framework & Design System is helping lay the
          groundwork for a greater push towards a wholly componentised approach
          providing all teams in the company with complete access to a shared component
          library, allowing them to mix and match from a predefined list of on-brand,
          fully-tested components. This approach will eventually provide incredible
          stability and identical core functionality, regardless of tech stack, device,
          or screen size.</p>

          <p>Paddy Power's newest In-play Betting Pages were developed as part of an
          initiative to create more in-house, best-in-class, products that would provide
          value to the company while simultaneously reducing dependencies on third-party
          clients. These pages use a number of new technologies such as AngularJS and
          WebSockets for realtime price updates.</p>

          <p>As part of working on the core functionality of the site, I also developed
          the initial project structure to allow the project to scale painlessly, as well
          as created an extensive Gruntfile that would handle a large number of tasks that
          were responsible for building the source files, committing the newly-built files

          <p>The Abacus CSS Framework is a powerful, modular, and lightweight CSS
          component library built using OOCSS and BEM notation, for use across all Paddy
          Power sites and products. It features a powerful mobile-first grid system,
          incredibly flexible components and is capable of delivering the entirety of
          Paddy Power's online branding and style, as well as full structure and layout
          support for mobile-first development in just 9KiB.</p>

          <p>The project is a slacktime project that I created to help intertwine the Web
          Development and Product Design teams to get them to communicate more, and help
          bring consistency to Paddy Power's branding and design across our entire online
          portfolio.</p>

          <p>It has given designers the ability to easily update the look and feel of all
          Paddy Power's online products, allowing them to confidently make changes while
          reducing the dependency on developers to make said changes on their behalf -
          freeing up valuable time for other projects.</p>

        <li>
          Successfully advocated for the use of <a href="https://www.pyrocms.com/">PyroCMS</a>
          on several of our microsites to allow hoteliers a friendly and easy interface
          to update their sites. The decision to use PyroCMS was based on the need for a
          CMS that was not only extremely lightweight and easy for customers to use, but
          was quick and easy to theme for.
        </li>
        <li>
          Completely redesigned and redeveloped the company's booking engine, offered to
          hoteliers for use on their own websites, and drastically improved UX resulting

        </li>
        <li>
          Lead the implementation of front-end frameworks and technology such as
          <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter's Bootstrap</a> which allowed
          allocating extra resources to back-end development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Introduced the use of the <a href="http://www.lesscss.org/">LESS CSS
          pre-processor</a> which decreased development time and enabled us to keep
          third-party libraries and code up-to-date with great ease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spearheaded the development of mobile-friendly themes for use on over 1,500
          microsites which would enable customers to book rooms with incredible ease

    period: 2013
    description: >-
      Oscailte is a free (as in beer) and open-source theme, built for use with the
      Octopress blogging framework. Designed to be highly customisable by simply setting 
      flags and changing config variables, it has proven to be a somewhat popular theme
      &mdash; allowing users to spend less time fighting with the theme and more time
      writing.

      DesktopVersion was a Reddit bot written entirely in Ruby that could scan recent

education:
  description: >-
    <p>I'm largely self-taught when it comes to front-end web development and have
    acquired these skills over the past few years by following blogs and tutorials by some
    of the most respected individuals in the industry such as
    <a href="https//paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a>,
    <a href="https//css-tricks.com/">Chris Coyier</a>,
    <a href="https//davidwalsh.name/">David Walsh</a>,
    and <a href="https//csswizardry.com/">Harry Roberts</a> - to name but a few.</p>
    
    <p>That being said, I <em>have</em> finished the following course:</p>
  courses:
    - degree: Certificate in Web Technologies 
      institute: NCI, Dublin
      year: 2013
      description: >-
        <ul>
          <li>Completed course with First Class Honours.</li>
          <li>
            Was elected class representative. During my tyranny, I encouraged fellow
            classmates to collaborate and share course notes with each other via Github
            repositories - inspired by the theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence">Collective Intelligence</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

interests: >-
  <p>There are a lot of things that I enjoy, but out of all of them, I enjoy these the
  most: reading about the latest advancements in web technologies &amp; reading in general,
  typography, music, fixing things most people would deem broken, playing games &ndash;
  board &amp; video, and taking myself seriously at times.</p>
  <p>I also have a strong passion for open-source technology
  (<a href="https://github.com/coogie/coogie.github.io/commits/master/cv.md">this CV is open-source!</a>)
  and a free and open Internet, and regularly donate to the
  <a href="https://donate.mozilla.org/en-GB/?currency=eur&amp;presets=20,10,5,3&amp;amount=10">Mozilla Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/">
