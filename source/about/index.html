        Hey! How's it going? My name is Stephen Coogan, and I'm a Front-End Web Developer from Dublin, Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been mucking about with code for nigh on eight years now, but it's only been in the past four years that I've taken it far more seriously. My expertise is deeply rooted in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript &mdash; including libraries such as jQuery.

    <h2 class="title--indent">A bit about this site</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        This site is powered by <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, an open-source blogging framework designed for <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and is hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. The theme is of my own creation and is released under the MIT License.
    </p>
    <p>
        The theme itself is built using the powerful inuit.css from Harry Roberts, and SASS. I have tried to keep JavaScript to a bare minimum as I feel it brings very little to a theme such as this.

    <h3 class="title--indent">My philosophy</h3>
    <p class="lead">
        When it comes to software and code, I believe that people should be as open as the technologies they use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Especially when it comes to front-end web technologies which - by their very nature and design - are the most open and accessible technologies on the planet to learn, and I feel that I should do whatever I can to help others learn how to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to design, the user should be put on a pedestal. Design so that they have the best experience possible, and they'll keep coming back.
