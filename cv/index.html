        </h1>

        <p>
            Working as part of the Paddy Power Sportsbook team, helping deliver a consistent and easy-to-use experience to millions of users per month by improving page performance and usability. Improving the lives and mental stability of in-house developers by refactoring HTML and CSS.

        <p>
            Paddy Power&#8217;s newest In-play Betting Pages were created as part of an initiative to create more in-house, best-in-class, products that would provide value to the company while simultaneously reducing depenencies on third-party clients. These pages use a number of new technologies such as AngularJS and WebSockets for realtime price updates.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of working on the core functionality of the site, I also developed the initial project structure to allow the project to scale painlessly, as well as created an extensive Gruntfile that would handle a large number of tasks that were responsible for building the source files, committing the newly-built files to Git, and automatically versioning the project according to <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a>. These Grunt tasks were also responsible for various other tasks such as compiling Sass files to CSS and the minification &amp; optimisation of all JavaScript.

        <h3 class="h6">Abacus CSS Framework <small class="muted">2015</small></h3>
        <p>
            The Abacus CSS Framework is a powerful, modular, and lightweight CSS component library built using <abbr title="Object-oriented CSS">OOCSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Block, Element, Modifier">BEM</abbr> notation, for use across all Paddy Power sites and products. It features a powerful mobile-first grid system, incredibly flexible components and is capable of delivering the entirety of Paddy Power&#8217;s online branding and style, as well as full structure and layout support for mobile-first development in <strong>just 9KiB</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project is a slacktime project that I created to help intertwine the Web Development and Product Design teams to get them to communicate more, and help bring consistency to Paddy Power&#8217;s branding and design across our entire online portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has given designers the ability to easily update the look and feel of all Paddy Power&#8217;s online products, allowing them to confidently make changes while reducing the dependency on developers to make said changes on their behalf - freeing up valuable time for other projects.

                Successfully advocated for the use of <a href="https://www.pyrocms.com/">PyroCMS</a> on several of our microsites to allow hoteliers a friendly and easy interface to update their sites. The decision to use PyroCMS was based on the need for a CMS that was not only extremely lightweight and easy for customers to use, but was quick and easy to theme for.
            </li>
            <li>
                Completely redesigned and redeveloped the company&#8217;s booking engine, offered to hoteliers for use on their own websites, and drastically improved UX resulting in increased conversion across many existing sites.

            <li>
                Introduced the use of the <a href="http://www.lesscss.org/">LESS CSS pre-processor</a> which decreased development time and enabled us to keep third-party libraries and code up-to-date with great ease.

            I was contracted by the studio to establish their online presence with a website. The website was initially raw HTML with PHP used to create includes for the header and footer and was my first foray into PHP. I have since rewritten the code and implemented PyroCMS for the backend to allow the client to update the site as they see fit.

        <p>
            Relationship with the client has steadily grown and recurring work with them has included the design of business cards and large-scale advertising banners.

            Gazebo is an open-source application for managing Dungeons &amp; Dragons groups, currently in planning stages. The purpose of the app is to familiarise myself with JavaScript MV* stacks such as <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, or <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>.

        <p>
            The app will allow the tracking of members of the group, shared information between group members, individual encounters, and eventually track in-depth data such as damage per player, per encounter.

    <h1 class="h2 title--indent">Education</h1>

    <p>
        I&#8217;m largely self-taught when it comes to front-end web development and have acquired these skills over the past few years by following blogs and tutorials by some of the most respected individuals in the industry such as <a href="//paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a>, <a href="//css-tricks.com/">Chris Coyier</a>, <a href="//davidwalsh.name/">David Walsh</a>, and <a href="//csswizardry.com/">Harry Roberts</a> - to name but a few.
    </p>

    <p>That being said, I <em>have</em> finished the following course:</p>

            <li>Was elected class representative.
